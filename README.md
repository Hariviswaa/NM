Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository contains code for image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Image classification is a task in computer vision where the goal is to assign a label or a class to an input image based on its content.

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)
NumPy
Matplotlib
Optional: CUDA and cuDNN for GPU support (if available)
You can install the required packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
You can use any image dataset suitable for the classification task. Popular datasets include CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, MNIST, etc. Make sure to organize your dataset in a suitable directory structure.

For example, if using CIFAR-10, the directory structure would look like:

bash
Copy code
dataset/
    train/
        airplane/
            image1.jpg
            image2.jpg
            ...
        automobile/
            image1.jpg
            image2.jpg
            ...
        ...
    test/
        airplane/
            image1.jpg
            image2.jpg
            ...
        automobile/
            image1.jpg
            image2.jpg
            ...
        ...
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset if necessary. This might include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, data augmentation, etc.

Model Training: Train a CNN model on the preprocessed dataset. You can choose from various architectures like VGG, ResNet, Inception, etc. Fine-tuning pre-trained models is also a common practice.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set to measure its performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used for evaluation.

Inference: Use the trained model to classify new images. Make sure to preprocess new images in the same way as the training images.
